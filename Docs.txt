Till Now I have implemented Amazon Home page and Cart Page  through JS 
And also write an separate code to format currency / money in dollars to show two decimal last so for that I create an separate folder Utils and there I create Money.js to write an code for formatting an money


--------------------------------------------
Now I'm facing an a problem on cart summary shipping delivery features shares same value like for example when I select free shipping the other is also select automatically so I need to resolve this issue 
So every radio share the same name that's why the problem is displaying
To resolve the issue we need to give unique name or id So here I can use products Id which is unique for every product.
